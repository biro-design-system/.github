**Biro UI** is a personal and open-source design system and UI framework created by Kuroji
Fusky; with a set of conventions inspired by popular design systems by Fandom Wiki,
Google, and Microsoft.

## Why is it called "Biro"?

I got the name **Biro** from the *Art & Biro* webcomic by Paco Panda — I was a huge fan of
his works and the main reason why I just chose this initially as a codename is because I’m
not particularly good at coming up and good names for any projects I work on (lol), but
overtime, I just sticked to it and make it as the final project name instead.

In short: so I chose Biro as I was not only a huge fan, but also something that I can easily
remember for both its codename and the project name.
